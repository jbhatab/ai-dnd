    "transcript" : "MATT\r\nWelcome to Wildemount. The year is 835 P.D., or post-Divergence. This continent is divided both by jagged terrain and political powers. The Menagerie Coast, a collection of city-states united under the Clovis Concord, monopolizes the southwestern shores and ports of Wildemount, thriving on open trade and cultural freedom. \u2192\r\nBeyond the Cyrios Mountains lies the massive region known as Wynandir, bisected by the Ashkeeper Peaks. Eastern Wynandir houses the expansive wastes and turbulent badlands of Xhorhas, overrun with all manner of beasts and terrors, relics from the final battles of the Calamity that ruined that scarred landscape. \u2192\r\nNorthward, you would find the Greying Wildlands, a lawless realm harboring a curse that has kept it unconquered by human hands. However, this story begins in the territory of Western Wynandir, within the boundaries of the Dwendalian Empire. \u2192\r\nEmerging 13 generations before, the Dwendalian Empire has slowly spread to encompass the surrounding societies of the region, absorbing the peoples of the Zemni Fields and the Marrow Valley, before finally conquering the Julous Dominion and taking the whole of Western Wynandir for the Empire. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nThere will be no test. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nNo. This is-- let me continue. Under the rule of the current King Bertrand Dwendal, now in his 68th year, most are left to their own devices. \u2192\r\nYou live as you did before. The crown only takes a tithe of what you produce and earn. You follow its laws, worship its gods, and bow to its installed local leadership. In return, denizens of the Empire are protected from the chaotic horrors and shadowed evils that stalk the edges of the civilized lands. This accord has led to a prosperous century for the Empire, or at least the political elite. Tensions brew beneath the chafing watch of the Crown's Guard. Every temple is government-owned and run, and worship outside the approved idolatry is met with imprisonment. \u2192\r\nRumors of military clashes at the eastern border near Xhorhas have many common folk on edge. Our story, however, begins much smaller. Here in the southern reaches of the Marrow Valley, beyond the entry gates of the Wuyun Gorge, lies the small rural town of Trostenwald. Bordering the blue waters of the Ustaloch, this town came to prominence near the turn of this recent century, when the surrounding fertile farmlands were discovered to produce a unique type of grain and wheat, leading to a boom of breweries. When the glut subsided, three large families stood triumphant in the local business of fermented delights. Now Trostenwald thrives on their exports of fish, crops, and ale. Here in this sleepy trade stop along the Amber Road, a handful of wandering destinies slowly begin to intersect. \u2192\r\nWe begin in the early hours of the morning on the day of Grissen in a messy room on the second floor of the Nestled Nook Inn. A bleary-eyed, bruised man in a tattered coat slowly wakens from his lengthy sleep, catching his small, snoring ally curled at the foot of the bed. Liam, if you would like to describe your character, please. \u2192\r\n(nervous laughter) \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nOh my god, no pressure! \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nWere we supposed to prepare this? \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nI'm pretty filthy. I have a mess of reddish-brown hair, and really filthy road clothes. I wear a long coat that I slept in. I slept about 20 hours last night. Jeez. Unshaven, a bit of a mess. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nSo far you're just talking about current Liam. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nWhat color are your eyes? I need visual. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nThey're blue. That's it. It was a rough day yesterday, and-- that's it. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nAnd your name is? \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nOh. Caleb. Caleb Widogast. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nAll right. As your smaller friend curls awake, Sam, would you like to describe your character? \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nYeah. Um. I am a little goblin girl. \u2192\r\n(laughter) \u2192\r\nI am a goblin. So, you know, the green skin, the green hair, the yellow eyes. And she wears not-great clothes, just like her traveling companion there. She hides in the shadows a lot, because she knows goblins aren't welcome in this part, and that's about it. I mean, she's a little skittish, and right now she's probably stirring awake as well, right? \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nWell. What's your name? \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nOh. Nott the Brave. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nSo Caleb, as you come to consciousness, you glance over and can see, slowly snoring and rousing at about the same time, Nott's eyes blink open, her slowly groaning face looking over towards you. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\n(high-pitched Cockney accent) Oh! You're finally awake, I see. Oh yeah, motherfuckers. It's on. You were out for quite some time, there. Rough day, eh? \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\n(light German accent) Not our best day, no. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nNo, I mean, usually you're so good at everything, but yesterday you were just-- maybe you needed the sleep, is what you needed. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nThank you. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nWell, don't thank me yet. I should probably tell you what happened while you were asleep. I mean, you were asleep for so long. I got bored, frankly. I was going through my pack and reorganizing. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nHas anybody seen you-- seen you seen you? \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nWell, I mean, many people? I got bored. \u2192\r\nYou've never slept that long, so I left, I went downstairs, I thought I'd do a bit of window-shopping, and you know how sometimes I get the itch, you know? \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nI do. Did you make it back here okay, at night? \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nI'm here, aren't I? \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nYeah, you are. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nYeah, I did. But I might have been spotted by a few of the Crown's Guard. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nDid you have the mask on? \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nNo? No, I didn't. But they didn't catch me, so. Listen, I'm sorry, sometimes I get the urge, I've got to take something, you know? I was trying to replentish what you lost yesterday, and I failed. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nWell, we-- (sighs)-- discussed coming to a bigger town. It's going to be a little more difficult now. You can't go-- it was easier on outskirts, it was easier in farms, but we can't do that here. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nI know, I'm sorry. Yeah. I know. You're right. Yep. I just got a little bit squiggly. \u2192\r\nThat's all. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nOkay. Well, I think today you should have the mask on at all times. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nYeah, good idea, Caleb. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nIt's better when we're working together. If you need to steal something, do it with my help, all right? \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nYeah, yeah, of course. Yeah. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nBack up the conversation a minute. Thank you. I would not be alive if you had not-- you saved my life. So thank you. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nAh, no problem. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nYesterday was really not great. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nYeah, well, we'll do better today, right? \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nSure. Sure we will. Are you hungry? \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nYeah, I'm starving. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nAt this point, you notice the gentle smell of cooked meats and promises of mediocre porridge and eggs just barely begins to creep beneath the subtle floor of your room, meet your nostrils. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nWell, Nott, what are we going to do today? I can go down and get breakfast and bring it up here. At least-- I don't know. I mean, I'm a little wary of just splashing back into the town right away. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nLet's go down, get some food. I'll come with you, 'cause as you said, we're better together. \u2192\r\nAnd we'll take it from there. You need some books and stuff, right? \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nAlways. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nAll right, well, that's on the to-do list. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nAll right, well, let's get something to eat, then. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nAll right, so you prepare yourself with your mask set over? \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nYes, yeah, so I have a half a mask that covers my goblin face, and with the hood over, kind of obscures. Maybe it's not a goblin, maybe it's a little halfling person or something. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nWhich is helpful. The southern, more rural region of the Empire, especially near Felderwin, which is one of the largest tilling and farming areas of the entire Empire, has a very heavy halfling population. And so while this city is not the core of it, you'd probably see a larger 20-25% of the population here in Trostenwald is halfling. \u2192\r\nSo you pass off pretty decently as long as you keep away from discerning, intent eyes. So the two of you manage to gather your things for the time being, wander down the stairs from the top floor down to the base of the tavern, which, the air is already bustling with townsfolk and all manner of travelers preparing to take on the day's responsibilities. Yorda, the 40-something woman barkeep with shoulder-length blonde hair and weathered skin that you previously rented your room at the inn from, frantically darts behind the bar while the red-headed barmaid rushes from table to table. It seems that the clientele is a bit more than they were expecting this morning. Yorda yells from behind the bar to the barkeep, \"Adelaine, two more brats and a bit of mush at the corner table.\" She looks up, \"I'm working on it!\" And she runs over and heads back to the kitchen. \u2192\r\nThere's a faint bit of music as two slovenly-looking musicians in the corner are trying to work for tips with a small hat on the floor that it looks like nobody's thrown any coin into it. The tables are fairly busy, except for maybe two that appear to be available between the two of you guys, if you'd like to find a seat. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nOkay. Sure. Is that easy to do, find a seat? \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nYeah, you walk over to it, you sit down. \u2192\r\n(laughter) \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nIs this how D&D works? \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nWhat do we roll for? (laughter) \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nYou sit down, and due to the chaos that ensues around you, it takes a little while for Adelaine, the red-headed barmaid, to come by, and she scoots by the table. \"I'm terribly sorry. What can I get you?\" \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nYou know, meat if you have it, but if you don't, that's okay, too. Potatoes, or bacon if it's on the menu, but really anything-- \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\n\"I can get you all three, it's fine. What you want?\" \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nA Trost for each of us, please. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\n\"For breakfast? I like you. All right, two Trosts and a bunch of meats. Be right back.\" And she rushes off, she pulls her hair back and ties it as she goes into the kitchen, getting ready for the midst of chaos. While you guys have a moment there at the table, you can hear conversation muttering around you, and you have a brief bit of privacy to discuss. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nYes, I need books, that's true, but did you find drink yesterday? \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nI have a little left in my flask. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nHow much? \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nJust a couple swigs. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nSo that's also on the to-do list, then. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nI mean, if you don't want me to get too jittery, yeah. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nAll right. Okay. So we'll do that first. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nAll right. \u2192\r\n# TRAVIS\r\nI love her. \u2192\r\n(laughter) \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nA short time passes before the two platters are rushed over and scattered across the front of your table with a clattering. Pile of meats there set for you, a little bit placed on the side, because you might need, especially with the look on your face-- Adelaine gives you a glance and goes, \"Put something in your belly.\" Comes back and slides two Trosts to you. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nI remove my little mask, and then just go (eating noises). \u2192\r\n(laughter) \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nI take the last piece. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nAs you guys are partway through your meal-- let's see, this would be Caleb. You notice out of the corner of your eye a gentleman enter the door looking kind of meek. Middle-age, looks work-hardened. He has a heavy chin-beard that is unkempt and a bit wild, but his eyes are warm. \u2192\r\nHe's holding his hat in his grip, and he scans the room with an eager glance before his face brightens, and he begins to push his way across the room, in your direction, it looks like. He scoots over towards your table, and as you're about to turn and see what he's about-- \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nI'm putting my hand on my purse. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\n--he pivots to the table next to you instead. He turns to you three. \u2192\r\n(yelps) \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nWe've just been sitting here this whole time! \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nYeah. You've met this man the day before, Rinaldo, the fisherman, who you had aided. And as he approaches, he goes, \"Might I sit, please?\" \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nOf course, take a seat. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nWhat's that? \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nAs he sits down in his chair, I would ask each of you to please describe yourselves, starting with you, Laura. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\n(Slavic accent) Oh, well, okay. I'm just, you know, a little blue tiefling, that's all, with blue hair. \u2192\r\nAnd I'm wearing a pretty cute dress, that's all. \u2192\r\nAnd I'm having a good time, you know? We're just having a good time here at breakfast. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nAll right. And you? \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nUh, yeah. Yeah. I'm, you know, simple girl, simple needs. Just wearing nice, baggy clothes, some monk vestiges. They're in nice blues and greys. You notice I have a blue sash around my belt. Got a nice shave going on, little undercut. \u2192\r\nLooks like maybe I put on makeup two days ago, and I'm like, yeah, it's still holding up. It's fine. \u2192\r\nI can work with that. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nWhat's your name? \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nWe'll get to that. Thank you. And Travis, if you'd like to describe yourself, please? \u2192\r\n# TRAVIS\r\n(Texan drawl) Yeah, I'm here too. \u2192\r\n(laughter) \u2192\r\nI'm a half-orc, sitting here in beat-up leathers. Have a big scar across my face. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\n(sings 'Bad to the Bone') (laughter) \u2192\r\n# TRAVIS\r\nGreen skin tone, and got some piecemeal armor put together and stuff. My name's Fjord. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nYou're very handsome. I just need to tell you. \u2192\r\n# TRAVIS\r\nThank you. Appreciate that. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nAs Rinaldo sits down, clutching his hat still in his hands, says, \"I thank you for your time. Fjord. And, I apologize, I forget your names.\" \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nBeauregard. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\n\"Beauregard. And?\" \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nJester. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\n\"Jester, thank you. You all came when no one else would yesterday, and because of you my daughter is still alive.\" \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nOh yeah. Sorry for being a pessimistic asshole, by the way, when we first came into town. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\n\"Oh, that's okay.\" \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nI'm not used to things turning out good. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\n\"You'll do well this side of the Empire. \u2192\r\nAnyway. I won't keep you, but I-- we spoke yesterday, and I didn't have much to give you. \u2192\r\nSent you away with nothing but my gratitude. But I've been asking around the other fishermen, lochsmen, and we've put together a little bit of coin for your troubles, so.\" And he turns his cap over on the table, and this catches your attention, you hear this clattering of coin. Your eyes glance over, especially you, Nott, and watch as he leaves this pile of what looks to be mostly copper and silver pieces, with a couple of glimmers of gold, and as soon as it clatters across the hard wood table here in the center of the tavern, other faces begin to turn, gather attention as to what's happening over here in the back edge, and he takes his cap back and pushes it forward towards all of you, his dirty, you can see cracked and very callused fingers shoving it in your direction, before taking his hat and placing it back over his head. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nSo cool! \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nThose coins went all over the floor? \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nAll over the table. \"I hope it's helpful. \u2192\r\nBut thank you.\" \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nYeah, yeah. Oh wait. \u2192\r\n# TRAVIS\r\nWe can't accept this, right? I mean, it's too much. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nWe're supposed to at least say that, right? And then still accept it, right? \u2192\r\n# TRAVIS\r\nI think you're supposed to do it if you say it. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nWell, I mean, he did go around to a bunch of people. That was a lot of work on his part. I would hate to make him go back to all of those people and give it back to each individual person. \u2192\r\n# TRAVIS\r\nFine, fine. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nIf he didn't keep a ledger, you know. We wouldn't want to do that. It's rude not to accept a gift, right? It's rude not to accept a gift, right? \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\n\"I would hope that is the case. Anyway. \u2192\r\nThank you very much. I am sorry for getting in your way.\" And he stands up and gives you all a nod and rushes out of the tavern, a little embarrassed by all the attention that's now placed on him by the other patrons, and as he leaves, everyone goes back to their business, a couple of wandering eyes starting to count what coins are there as you slowly mitt them in your direction. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nDivide it up. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nOkay, okay. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nThere are four gold pieces amongst the pile, 22 silver, and 48 copper pieces. \u2192\r\n# TRAVIS\r\nCan I clock the room, see who else is watching her count? \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nPerception check. 48 copper. \u2192\r\n# TRAVIS\r\nIs this the first roll? \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nFirst roll of the campaign. \u2192\r\n# TRAVIS\r\nNatural 20. \u2192\r\n(cheering) \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nAnd that's how you start it. All right. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nSo I'm leaving it to you to do that counting. Which is really hard for me, personally, but there you go. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nHow do you split up four gold? We have four gold and there's only three of us. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nDon't know. \u2192\r\n# TRAVIS\r\nWell, I actually did pretty good at that card game, so you can have mine. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nAw. I will. Okay. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nSo two for each of us! That's great. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nOh, that's good. One for you, two for me, two for-- oh wait, no, wait, math doesn't make sense. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nShe's your treasurer? \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nThis is going to go great. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nIt's hard not being the treasurer. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nI'll give two to Jester, one for you, one for me. And then 22 silver, that's-- \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nTell you what, you do that math. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nWhile you're counting this out and figuring out the division of your gains, Fjord, you glance about, narrowing your orcish eyes across the room, and you can see two other tables there are some gentlemen who are peering over, and as soon as they meet your gaze, they go right back to their business and completely shrink away. There's a man and a hooded figure at a table immediately adjacent to you. The man looks rather filthy, his hair a bit unkempt, and he's trying to finish his drink. However, the smaller halfling-looking figure is just glaring intently, and is slowly leaning in the direction of the table. \u2192\r\n# TRAVIS\r\nThat's creepy. Fucking disgusting. I think we have people watching us. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nWho is watching us? \u2192\r\n# TRAVIS\r\nWell, just take a look right over there. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nDon't arouse suspicion, but did you hear all that coin hit that table, Caleb? \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nI did. It's on the table, though, so I think on the table it will stay. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nYes, but we could follow them out. We could do the Moneypot. We could run Rat Food. We could do Prince and the Pauper to get it from them. We could try Spider Eyes. Any of those could work-- \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nAre you guys staying here? \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nThis blue-skinned tiefling suddenly leans over to you at the table. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nDon't move. Don't move. Tieflings can only see movement. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nI don't think that's true-- \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nIt's very true, we have a hard time seeing things that aren't moving, it's very true. But I can hear you. You should take a bath. You know they have showers here. It's possible. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nA what now? \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nYou bathe yourself in water. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nNo, I've bathed before, yeah, I know what a bath is. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nIt's because you smell really bad, and it's wafting over this direction. I'm just letting you know. I would hate if I smelled that bad and someone didn't tell me. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nI've only just met you. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nHi! I'm Jester. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nHi, I'm Caleb. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nNice to meet you, Caleb. How much silver did I just get? \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nSeven! \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nWoo! (laughter) \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nAnd 16 copper. Aren't you all jealous? \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nMorning. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nMorning. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nMake a perception check, Beauregard and Jester. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nWhoa. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nAre you checking your DnD Beyond specs? \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nI am, I'm adding my-- \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\n22. I haven't even flipped over my character sheet yet. This is crazy. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\n19. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nOkay. The somewhat meek female halfling who's now suddenly very reserved, and not as filthy as the human compatriot that she keeps, seems less and less halfling the more you glance in her direction. The ears are folded inward but elongated, the tinges of green to the skin, and with the little words that have poked through her lips, you can see what appear to be teeth more jagged than expected of the half-folk. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nI just shout over and I say, good morning, in Halfling. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nI know Halfling, right? Yes. I'll shout back, top of the morning to you. \u2192\r\n(laughter) \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nWould you like a coffee? I'd love to buy you a coffee. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nWe've got-- free coffee? Yeah, yeah, I'll take it. Sure. Thank you. \u2192\r\n# TRAVIS\r\nYou're being mighty fucking friendly. They were looking at our coin. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nWhy can't they have been looking at me? Maybe they were looking at me. \u2192\r\n# TRAVIS\r\nI didn't think of that. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nMaybe they were looking at you. As Jester said, you're handsome. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nJust-- \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nYes? \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nNott. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nHe said \"Jest\". \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nI just thought you said my name, is all. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nOh, I said your name. Oh, they might have said your name, too. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nNever mind, never mind. Could I get another Trost over here, please? \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nTwo, please, right away. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nEventually Adelaine comes by and brings two fresh Trosts to the table, glancing about at the unique tension in the air right here. \"Would you like anything as well?\" \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nOh, yes. Lots of baked goods if you have them, please. \u2192\r\n# TRAVIS\r\nPork belly, if you have it. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nI don't think I've seen you eat anything other than pastries. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nI really like them. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nI'm kind of concerned for your well-being. It's fine, I'm not that concerned. \u2192\r\nEat whatever you want. I'll have bacon, some ham, whatever. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\n\"All right, pork it is. I'll be right back.\" She rushes off to the kitchen. You guys continue to awkwardly stare at each other. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nI'm going to put my hand up and say, quietly, to Nott, the Moneypot is not for them. \u2192\r\nIt's not for them, it's for farmers. Okay? \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nYeah, you're right, you're right. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nDo we notice them whispering? \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nWith your perception rolls earlier? Yes. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nBut I said it really quietly. \u2192\r\n(laughter) \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nShe rolled a 22. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nBut she can hear my little whisper? \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nNo, you heard the whisper, you're not sure what the words are. You can see that they're whispering. Being mysterious. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nOkay, cool. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nIn Halfling, I'll say to Beau-- \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nBeau for short works. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nAre you in town for business or pleasure? \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nCan I insight check him, see what he's hiding? \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nMake an insight check. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nOkay. What's my insight, I can't remember. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nWhat is he saying? I mean you, you're a girl. What is she saying? Shit. That's really hard to remember now. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nYou're asking me what I'm saying. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nYeah, what did you just say? \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\n13. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\n13? I mean, seems to be genuine. Hard to read through all the wrappings, shadow, and the hood still obscuring the face. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nDo you have the mask covering you? \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nI think I do. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nYeah, it's this porcelain covering that has painted lips. It's a little unsettling. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nI mean, I'm sorry, not to be blunt, but, you know. It's pretty obvious goblins are not welcome strolling about. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nShe's a goblin?! \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nYeah, yeah, but you don't have to make a big thing of it, all right? There could be people here who don't know. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nThat's right. She's my companion, she's my friend. There's nothing to make a big deal about. \u2192\r\nThat's why she's wrapped up. Just leave it, please. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nI didn't ask why she was wrapped up. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nI know, we're not making a big deal out it. You're making a big deal out of it. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nSomebody asked why she was wrapped up. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nNo, nobody asked. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nSomebody said the words-- this is Liam-- \"Why are you all wrapped up?\" \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nOh, I asked if she was cold. \u2192\r\n(laughter) \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nThat's concern. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nAs Caleb finishes oversharing. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nVaxleth is over. It's so over! \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nThose are old times, man. That was a different universe. Different life. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nAt this point, there is a bit of a commotion towards the entrance of the tavern. Two shadows step into the doorway of the nearish-noonday sun. \u2192\r\nThe figures, one eclipsing the other from behind, begin to step in. You notice one of them begins to step from table to table, glancing about with a sort of grace to the movement, the other staying a few feet behind. Taliesin, if you'd like to describe your character, please. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nI didn't think we were going to meet you so soon! \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nNeither did I. \u2192\r\n# ASHLEY\r\nI didn't either. \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nBut here we are. A lavender-- damn it, Travis. A lavender tiefling with red eyes and very pierced, extremely ostentatious horns that are pierced with little gems and little baubles. He's got a tattoo that seems to be running up the side of his face, a peacock tattoo that goes off into his very ostentatious, ridiculous, overblown robes that he wears. His two swords and pouch dangling at the side of his hips. He's very broad in his dress. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nSo a literal and figurative peacock. \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nOh yes. \u2192\r\n# TRAVIS\r\nOne of your characters? No. \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nI know, mine. Who knew? \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nAs this tiefling darts from table to table, a few feet behind, you see-- \u2192\r\n# ASHLEY\r\nWait, did you say your name? \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nI didn't say my name. \u2192\r\n# ASHLEY\r\nOkay. So there is a woman behind him. Taller than your average... lass. \u2192\r\n(laughter) \u2192\r\nShe's very, very, very pale-skinned. Her hair is black that starts to turn white as it gets longer. It's matted, it's dreaded, it's braided. \u2192\r\nHer clothes are a bit tattered, but just sort of-- she's a bit of a mess, and she has two different color eyes. One of them is a light greenish-blue, and the other is a violet color. And she's very standoffish, hunch-y, arms folded. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nYou watch as these figures slowly move from table to table, the tiefling engaging in some distant conversation, leaving a slip of paper, walking to the next table. Gauging the atmosphere, not leaving a slip of paper, and quickly moving on, and then eventually your eyes meet what looks to be two tables with a very motley crew of individuals that are both awkwardly avoiding their own tension and currently trying to figure you out. \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nCan I tell if-- where are they in the dispensement of the coin? Can I tell they have a little coin on them? Did I catch any of that? \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nThey've completed distributing, so you don't see any coin, unfortunately. \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nWell. I don't believe I've ever seen a group of people more in need of a good time in my entire life. Mollymauk Tealeaf of the Fletching and Moondrop Traveling Carnival of Curiosities. If there was ever a group of people that needed a good time to go out, have a laugh, see things that you have never seen before, and my god, take my word for it, one month's time, people will be buying your ale to hear the tale of what you saw at the Traveling Carnival of Curiosities this night. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nWe saw your tent going up! We did! \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nWe were actually going to go without the flyer, but now we also have a flyer. \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nIt's just five copper. A steal. At five silver, it would be a steal, at five gold? Worth every penny. But if you've got the five copper to spend, we would happily have you all. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nDo you perform? \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nAh. I'm less of a performer and more of an intermediary for these parts. I do on occasion perform. I can read fortunes-- \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\n(gasps) I was going to ask if you read fortunes! Can you do one now? \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nI knew you were going to ask that. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\n(gasps) Oh my gosh, you're so smart. Look at this guy, he knows everything! \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nI'm going to sit down at the table. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nOkay. He goes and sits down at this table, finishing his presentation. One of the barmaids comes up to you, and looks up. You're standing almost a solid seven inches taller than her. \u2192\r\n\"Miss, can I get you a drink?\" \u2192\r\n# ASHLEY\r\n(deadpan) Yes could I have a drink, please. Just some ale. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\n\"Coming right up. Any preferences for the family? Baumbauch?\" \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nStay clear of Baumbauch. They're dicks. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nThat's kind of true. \u2192\r\n# ASHLEY\r\nJust a big. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\n\"Husseldorf, then. All right. Be right back.\" And she wanders off. \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nWell. Who has coin for a fortune? \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nDo you know my name? \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nWhat is your name? \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nJester. \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nI know your name now! \u2192\r\n# LAURA, TALIESIN\r\n(laugh) \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nWhat is your name? \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nOh, my name is Molly to my friends, and we're friends, now, aren't we? Pleasure. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nMolly. Look at this guy. \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nMollymauk. Molly for short. This is Yasha, she's a charm. \u2192\r\n# ASHLEY\r\nHello. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nYasha. Yasha. \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nNow. Would anyone like a fortune read? \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nI would love one. \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nDo you have coin? \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nYes. How much do you want? \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nTwo copper. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nTwo copper, okay, I just got some copper. \u2192\r\nHere you go. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nMark down your two copper. (laughs) \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nI am taking this in. All right. (sighs) I'm going to try and do this. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nOh my gosh, really? \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nSo, as he pulls out a small set of cards and begins to shuffle them, go ahead and roll an insight check. \u2192\r\n# ASHLEY\r\n(deadpan) He's really quite good, you all should line up and get your fortunes told. \u2192\r\n(laughter) \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nLet's do a 16 there. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nOkay, so you get a brief conversation here, you get a pretty solid read: the excitability, the eagerness, and the exuberant interest in just getting in your face that this person wants-- any fortune you tell will probably suffice. Go ahead and roll a sleight-of-hand check as well. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nLook at this fucking game! (laughter) \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nAlso 16. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nYeah. And you feel pretty confident that her eyes are locked onto your eyes at the moment and not the deck, as you set up a proper reading. And the cards are shuffled, set, you place them before you, and you may give your fortune. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nI'm going to just keep my eyes open for any tricks of the hand, sleight-of-hand-y-type tricks. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nMake a perception check. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nOkay. Perception. 14. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\n14. All right. Everything seems pretty above-board. \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nYour first card, the Silver Dragon. This is good. You're pure, you're virtue, you are a worthwhile and wonderful human being, obviously, or creature of some repute. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nThat's what everyone always tells me. \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nIt's true. And heading towards the Anvil. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nWhat is that? \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nThat is a destiny forged. \u2192\r\n# ASHLEY\r\n(deadpan) Ohh. \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nThere is something bright and adventurous in your future. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nWow! You know, we did just defeat a really big snake? So maybe there's even bigger things coming up, you know? \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nCan I make another roll? \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nSure. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nAshley confirmed worst hype-man ever. \u2192\r\n(laughter) \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\n19. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nYeah, easy enough. Even with discerning eyes at the table, you are at the top of your game. \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nThe Serpent card appears. Of course you did. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\n(gasps) Oh my gosh! Look at that! How did you even do that? \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nThat's all the cards. I'm simply a vessel for higher powers. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nWhile everybody's watching this shit happen, may I cast Detect Magic? \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nYou may. You lean back and subtly begin a brief muttering of an incantation, your fingers wash through the air, a faint silver gleam across your fingertips. Nothing magical shows up in the immediate vicinity. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nWill you ask the cards if I'm going to find him? \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nIf you're going to find her? \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nHim. \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nGive me a little bit more. Who's this 'him' that you're looking for? \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nI'm looking for my dad. \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\n14. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nYou fumble for a second, but the card still finds its way through without issue. \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nPushing through, pushing through. The Eye card pulls up. You've already found the clue you're looking for. You just don't know what it is yet. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nReally? \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nApparently. Well, it's what the cards are saying. It's right in front of you. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nWow. Does it say how long ago I found it? Because that's-- \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nSadly, I don't have that sort of specifics. That's much more expensive. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nThat's going to take a lot of thinking. \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nWell, you find us at the show, you'll find my tent and I'd be happy to give you a more complicated reading. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nI can't wait! It's going to be so much fun. \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nSo much fun. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nYasha, at this point, the barmaid, Adelaine, comes up and hands you the ordered ale. \u2192\r\n# ASHLEY\r\nThank you, my lady. \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\n\"On the house.\" \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nOn the house! \u2192\r\n# ASHLEY\r\nThat's very kind of you. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nDo you perform in the circus, too? \u2192\r\n# ASHLEY\r\nNo. I do not. I just-- I put it up. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nOh, cool. \u2192\r\n# TRAVIS\r\nThe tent. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nIt's a big tent. It would take a lot of work. \u2192\r\n# ASHLEY\r\nI put up the stage, I move things around. \u2192\r\nI'm very strong. But I don't do anything in the show. \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nSome of our acts are a little complicated, with performers who are not of the traditional variety. Can make some of the locals get a little shifty, if you know what I mean, and it's good to have a few people around who are capable of keeping issues contained. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nIs that why it says 'No admittance to the elderly'? You don't want to deal with those riley elderly. Or the ill, yeah. Why no elderly, though? Ill kind of makes sense, but elderly? \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nWe cannot be held responsible for anything that may happen to someone who is ill or infirm. It is such an exciting, impressive show. \u2192\r\n# ASHLEY\r\nWe've had people die watching it. \u2192\r\nYeah. It's just that exciting. Just from excitement. \u2192\r\n# TRAVIS\r\nDid they die in the show, or from watching it? \u2192\r\n# ASHLEY\r\nYeah, just like heart attack. Just from getting so excited, I guess. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nWe gotta get so wasted. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nWhen is it? How long is it? When is it? \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nIt is actually the day of Grissen, and your first show is today. \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nFirst show is tonight. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nWell, we have plans tonight! \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nYay! \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nDo you stinky people want to come with us? \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nI-- Caleb, we don't have any plans tonight. I guess we could go along. I wouldn't mind seeing it. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nIt'll be fun! \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nOr you could stay here and buy beer for the people who do see the shows, and you can hear all about it and pay more. \u2192\r\n# LIAM\r\nYeah, we can go. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nIt's going to be so much fun. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nYeah, yeah, it sounds like a good night. \u2192\r\nYeah. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nLook at all these friends we're making here. This is a good city. \u2192\r\n# SAM\r\nYeah, it is. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nYeah, yeah. \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nYou are all the most charming people I've met in-- yes. I finish my beer. (sighs) Well, we'd better be getting on. \u2192\r\n# ASHLEY\r\nYep, nice to meet you all. You're so, uh, wonderful. \u2192\r\n# TALIESIN\r\nCharm. Pure charm. See you tonight! \u2192\r\n# MATT\r\nAnd as they leave you, Yasha just downs her entire ale, slams it on the table, and they both walk out, passing a couple more flyers at off tables, and then exit out to the rest of the day's sun beyond your sight. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nShe was awesome. \u2192\r\n# TRAVIS\r\nShe didn't say much. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nThat's why I liked her. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nShe was really, really cool. Did you see that cool thing she had going on with her chin? That's interesting. I wish I would have thought of something like that. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nYeah, I mean, you could maybe do something like that in time. Just wait until maybe-- \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nSo she doesn't know I copied. I can't do it tonight. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nNo, no. \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nWow. Cool. What do you guys want to do now? (laughter) \u2192\r\n# TRAVIS\r\nWas he using magic? \u2192\r\n# LAURA\r\nI don't know. \u2192\r\n# MARISHA\r\nAre you-- you're superstitious. Yeah? \u2192\r\n"
